# Samples (modified) for 201 Pocket Piano

This is the samples "synth" by Critter & Guitari for the
201 Pocket Piano. Modifications are:
* There's no decay on samples; they just stop.
* Some original samples replaced by car interior sounds.

A reminder about what the knobs do:
1. Length of sample to play (proportionally);
2. Pitch/speed shift (50% is no shift);
3. Surprise! Chance of mixing another sample.
